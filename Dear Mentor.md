Dear Mentor,

This is my final project.

To ensure proper functionality of the CRUD operations, it is required to log in as an admin. You can find a demonstration of the app's features in the video located in the Dropbox folder associated with this project.

# Admin Access:

The application includes an admin role with a designated username and password. The admin has the authority to correct country information, descriptions, and dates.

Admin
Username: tee
Password:12345

# User Access:

Normal users, such as travel bloggers, can register and only add new countries to the system.

Normal
Username: Moni
Password:123456
